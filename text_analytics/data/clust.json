As the World Economic Forum\u2030\u00db\u00aas 13th edition of the Global Information Technology Report http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalInformationTechnology_Report_2014.pdf points out, there is a need to address the risk of a socio-economic asymmetry in the new digital economy. More specifically, a balance needs to be found among the interests of citizens that fear losing control over their personal data, of businesses that require innovative products and more efficiency, and of the government that by itself needs to unite several competing goals including growth promotion, commitment to guarantee privacy for its citizens and provision of public services to its citizens.","\"that are agreed upon in close collaboration with the community of official statistics\"","For this Charter initiative to be successful, it is vital to ensure a close collaboration of the various groups working on the implementation of the Data Revolution, of the Open Data Partnership, of the G7/8 and G20 efforts etc. in a continuous way.

There are no reasons that I'm aware of why businesses should open up data for public benefit that do not apply to non-profits.\n\n Although that opens up a whole can of worms if it seems that open data now provides government with an excuse to require data from civil society organizations (those which documenting human rights abuses vs those which operate long term care facilities for the elderly financed by government grants).","We will:\n provide certainty in the supply of the data and engage with re-users before changes to the structure or supply are made to provide confidence and minimise the impact to re-users that have built businesses based on open data.","May I suggest that we include \"Observe data privacy rules\"","I agree with Martin and Jose. The language in Paragraph 5 comes from para 4 in the G8 Open Data Charter, but the G8 Charter also contains a list of 14 high value data categories and associated datasets in a Technical Annex. In the absence of a similar list, paragraph 5 on its own risks giving a very misleading impression of what open data is about. In general I think the Charter needs to define \u2018open data\u2019, the subject of the Charter, in the preamble, and illustrate its scope. Alternatively, a similar approach could be taken to the G8 Charter through inclusion of an illustrative list of data categories/data sets in a Technical Annex.","There is reference to technical annexes, but there is no technical annex in the consultation draft.","Suggest that a new paragraph be inserted at this point referring to what the Charter builds on, so that the Charter stands alone in terms of the context of where it has come from. There is a paragraph on the home page of the international charter as follows that could be drawn on: \u2018Building on efforts that have already been undertaken in relation to the G8 Open Data Charter, the G20 commitment to open data principles, the UN Secretary General\u2019s Independent Expert Advisory Group on the Data Revolution, the Data Revolution Task Force, and a number of other multilateral groups and initiatives\u2026\u2019","This para refers to \u2018open data and information.\u2019 What does \u2018information\u2019 refer to in this context? Does it mean information related to open data (\u2018open data and related information\u2019), such as meta data? Otherwise \u2018information\u2019 is very open ended.","This para refers to publishing comprehensive lists of data holdings. The G8 charter contains, in the technical annex, a statement that \u2018we will publish data on a national portal so that all government data that has been released can be found easily in one place.\u2019 This could be worth including in the International Charter.","This refers to releasing data in multiple formats. The wording of best practice 9 in the G8 charter could be worth incorporating \u2013 it goes further and refers to details of usability and the meaning of open formats \u2013 although perhaps the intention is not to make the International Charter too detailed by incorporating all the good practices from the G8 Charter (some of the G8 practices appear to have been incorporated in principles 2 and 4 of the international charter).","Suggest that a reference to the potential for \u2018co-creation\u2019 of data through public inputs be added e.g. by using smart phones for on-the-spot reporting of traffic jams, local weather, disasters/incidents, local pollution etc etc.","Last bullet refers to \u2018empowering data innovators by \u2026increasing open data literacy\u2026\u2019 Increasing open data literacy is important for reasons that go beyond empowering data innovators; data literacy is important also to improve citizen understanding of how public resources are used, to help hold public officials to account. Suggest that the importance of data literacy should be in a separate bullet point and not confined to supporting data innovators.","It might be useful to explain a bit on how open data is essential to meet challenges. Perhaps by citing some examples ?","Instead of only 'easily discoverable, useable, or understandable', my suggestion is to put 'granular, disaggregated, easily discoverable, usable, or understandable'","Can we add something that reflects the essence of Open Data providing avenues for citizens and citizen groups to hold their government accountable ?","I think this should read \"resources\" instead of \"tools\", taking into consideration the differences in access to financial, technological and human resources. Many developing states will not just need the technology, but the financing and expertise in order to enact this charter.","I believe this should be written either as the first paragraph under this Principle or in the preamble. It presents an interpretation of \"government data\" that is critical to interpreting the rest of the document","I think this should be restated as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153informed by consultation with citizens, other governments, NGOs and other open data users\u00e2\u20ac\u009d instead of \"informed by public requests\" so that it reads better in accordance with paragraph 17.","Is this in reference to Creative Commons Licences? If so, the particular licence or type of creative commons licence should be referred for clarity.","The language in the Charter's preamble already contains strong references to principles of democratic, transparent, and accountable government. In addition, it might be worth considering to strengthen the reference to the centrality of data, and in this context in particular open data, for evidence based decision-making that drives poverty reduction and underpins sustainable development. \n\n\n\nGreater openness of highly granular development data sets is also likely to increase their use by government and other actors and will drive improvements in data quality (which is in turn likely to encourage further use in decision-making and monitoring, and therefore effectiveness of development interventions).","As others have pointed out, a broader formulation of 'governments, international institutions, businesses and civil society organisations' might be useful here.  \n\nTo make the link to the wider development/SDG agenda, perhaps this could be reformulated to 'economic growth that leaves no one behind'.","Comparability based on interoperability of data is also important in this context, to underpin greater use. Perhaps this could be added, but in language that will resonate with non-technical audiences. Could perhaps be done by adding 'comparable' in the last sentence of the paragraph.\nThe last sentences could perhaps be combined to phrase it positively, for example a in 'Governments have  huge opportunity to share more data in ways that make it easily discoverable, useable, (comparable) and understandable by the public. This will unlock new insights and innovations.'","Is it useful perhaps to include a reference to 'timely' data in this section? In the bullet section,  references to 'driving improvements' and 'monitoring performance' could be emphasised.\nAnother bullet could be around open data empowering people to reduce vulnerability, create opportunities and choice.","Agree with the comments by others that it is data that is under-used and that openness can contribute to overcoming this challenge.","Either under Principle 2 or 3, a specific mention of interoperability of open data would be helpful as it is critical to usability. It could be expressed as either a component of quality, or as a principle under 3 in terms of a broader effort of working towards interoperability of open data.","The suggested mention of working towards interoperability of open data could also be made under this Principle.\nOthers have commented on the importance of highlighting collaboration with various other 'open' and Data Revolution initiatives, which feels important. In particular, it may be useful to reference the Africa Data Consensus, which makes reference itself to open by default principles for official data. http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/PageAttachments/final_adc_-_english.pdf","The word 'movement' can perhaps be replaced by 'transformation.' 'Movement' tends to suggest some kind of unity of purpose or objective, which is not perhaps what is meant here.","Is it possible to add 'transparent' to 'accountable, efficient, responsive, and effective'?","Perhaps 'transformation' and not 'movement'.","Perhaps insert 'sustainable' before 'economic development'.","In the second sentence, none of the action phrases ('enable collaboration' and 'effective oversight' and 'innovation' and 'develop effective, efficient') are speaking about either democracy or justice. The focus seems to be completely on effectiveness. Phrases like 'transparent', 'accountable', and 'participatory' should be introduced here.","The above point clarifies why 'data is essential' but not why 'open data is essential'. The connection between democracy and justice on one hand, and open data on the other is not yet articulated clearly.","Along with allowing 'insights' and 'innovations' to develop, can it also be highlighted that open data make processes transparent?","...make _decisions_ and processes transparent...","I agree with above comments that it is perhaps better to articulate this not as 'missed opportunity' but to highlight this as the very 'opportunity' that the open data agenda is interested in capturing.","This point may also mention that some people are interested in using government data to open up government decisions and processes and make them transparent, which is a necessary condition for making the government accountable.","Perhaps 'democratic participation' can be added after 'sustainable and inclusive growth'. That is: 'Providing access to government data can drive sustainable and inclusive growth, and democratic participation, by empowering citizens...'","The incentive for private sector and CSOs to open up data is not clear. Overall benefit may rise with them opening up data, but how does a private company / CSO benefit by opening up its data?","","Along with 'stronger' and 'more interconnected', please mention 'more transparent' and 'more democratic'. Also it is not clear what is meant by 'stronger'.","[B]etter meet the needs of our citizens' does not necessarily suggest a more democratic or just society, but a more effective welfare distribution system. Please add '... and empower the citizens to ensure accountability of the government.'","Does it makes sense to remove the 'Quantity and Quality' point and merging it with 'Accessible and Usable by All'? Data quantity and quality issues, along with those related to publication of data, can all logically follow under the topic of data access and use. For example, highly aggregated data published once a year without documentation is not really usable data.","We (at CIS) strongly feel that the Charter should also prescribe that along with the national Action Plan, Open Data Citizen's Charters are created for various levels and verticals of the government. This will clarify data publication responsibilities and targets at ministerial and sub-national (including city) governmental levels, and will allow for much more effective monitoring  (national and international) of the Action Plan implementation process.","[A]t a minimum of every two years' reads a bit unclear. Does it mean that the Action Plan should be renewed only after two years and not before, or that the Action Plan should be renewed every two years or before that?","Along with clarifying the scope of 'government data,' the idea of 'open' in the context of data needs a clear definition as an independent point. The document is getting into 'open by default' without clarifying what is 'open', including both necessary and sufficient conditions.","I agree with \tMike Linksvayer. This is a great opportunity for the Charter to connect the open data agenda with the wider open agendas, especially that of free and open source softwares. It is very important that this point promotes 'global development of free and open source tools'.","Extending the comment by Jose Subero, along with 'tools' and 'policies', it will be great to have a mention of 'standards' here, which is critical for ensuring 'interoperability' and thus 'harmonisation'.","It is wonderful that the point promotes a wide understanding of 'government data' but at the same time it should also define a necessary core understanding of data, just to ensure that governments do not interpret this point too narrowly.","Further, a focus only on data created  by public agencies can perhaps be too narrow (for the necessary/core understanding of 'government data'). With public services delivered increasingly by private agencies and public-private-partnerships, it is crucial that 'government data' should explicitly include any data coming out of a process funded by public money (the process may be carried out by a public agency or not). This is an extremely important point from a developing country perspective.","From a developing country perspective, it is very important that the Charter does not keep this critical point dependent on domestic and international legislations. International legislation may not be very developed for all of the mentioned topics, and many countries may not have existing domestic legislations on these topics either. The Charter should mention an internationally acceptable list of concerns / criteria for not opening up data. The list may include the topics mentioned here, like privacy and national security. This need not be a list of sufficient criteria, but of necessary ones.","Administrative reforms' are most often crucial to make government data 'open by default, and the same should be mentioned along with 'policies' and 'practices'.","This is a great point. Perhaps it can be added that all government agencies should produce a list of all data assets maintained by them, point out the ones that cannot be made open, and provide clear justification as to why those cannot be released.","Along with 'leadership, management, oversight, and internal communication', is it possible to add 'incentives'? This is often overlooked in implementing open data policies.","","Points 16-18 seem to suggest that the 'quantity and quality' issue is mostly one of prioritisation. This can be misleading. This is perhaps the 'quantity' issue, but not at all the 'quality' issue.","Please add 'human- and machine-readable' along with 'timely, comprehensive, and accurate'.","Put ', and' between ', and accurate' and 'in accordance'.","Relevant guidance or documentation' should be mentioned before, and not after, 'visualisations or analyses'.","Add that the documentation should be 'comprehensive', along with being written in plain language.","Is this the necessary definition of 'open data'? If so, it should be much higher up.","This point should clarify if it is talking about making revisions of the data itself (its content), or how it is being published (its form), or both?","The 'as long as they retain value' part seems vague. Who is going to take this decision about value? Is it possible to rephrase this as 'as long as they are demanded by data users'?","Maybe 'government data' and not 'open data' (open data already means it is available gratis). Also, along with 'free of charge' maybe add 'under open license', as that is a critical requirement for 'widest possible use.'","I strongly believe that this point should be removed. Registration of the data user can also be very useful for the government agencies to track demand and actual usage of their datasets. Instead of the government agencies doing such kind of tracking as a background process, it is much better if the data usage monitoring of all users is done transparently. Along with perhaps a public dashboard of data usages of the users of an open data portal. As long as the registration barrier does not involve an approval process by the government agency, it can be allowed.","A more general point should be added as part of this principle, regarding no-discrimination (or approval process) among data users interested in accessing and using of open government data.","Comments proposed to the International Open Data Charter in the context of the inclusive global consultation process \n\nWe fully support the philosophy and content of the current draft International Open Data Charter and we are convinced that Open Data are one of the more powerful development and innovation engine in a globalized world, taking into account the information society where we are all living. \n\nWe would like to propose some ideas with the intention of obtaining a deeper and more effective implementation of Open data ideas.\n\nI) First Proposal\nRationale\nThe production of some open data category, specially geospatial data but also statistics and Earth observation data, by public sector implies expensive, complex and long production processes that demand the investments of high budgets. At present, in many contexts the needed investment is partially covered by the benefits obtained by selling and licensing data under a commercial non-open approach.\n\nTherefore, the commitment of governments to implement open data should be accompanied by a commitment to raise and sustain the budget invested in the production and maintenance of such open data.\n\nThis is especially important in the case of geospatial data; a particular data category which intends to model real natural world and it is fuzzy, fractal, non-normalized, implies huge volumes of data and has a very high dynamism. From our experience as geospatial data producers, and as a consequence of those intrinsic characteristics, the effort, money, time and hours-person required in any geospatial data production and maintenance project are very often underestimated.\n\nOn the other hand, a variety of new technologies and applications related to globalization and information society (Internet of Things, Location Based Services, routing, tracking and so on) requires more and more detailed and more frequently updated geospatial data to meet their objectives.\n\nThose reasons make necessary to guarantee the required public investments to generate, maintain, structure and properly deliver geospatial data and other open data categories with similar problems.  \n\nProposal\nTo add a sixth open government data principle:\n6. Sustained long-term public investment\n29) We recognize that the production of some open data category, specially geospatial data but also statistics and Earth observation data, in public sector implies expensive, complex and long production processes that demand the investments of high budgets. At present in many contexts the needed investment is partially covered by the benefits obtained by selling and licensing data under a commercial non-open approach.\n\n30) We will raise and maintain under a sustained approach the budget invested in the production and maintenance of such open data.\n\nII) Second Proposal\nRationale\nIn the field of geospatial information we are seeing that official geospatial data are not always used as reference data in order to have a general common spatial reference to generate all kind of thematic data. One of the main reasons for that is that not always governmental geospatial data are published under open conditions.\n\nProposal\nTo add a new point 5) after current point 4) in the Preamble:\n5) Some data generated by public sector, especially in the domain of geospatial information, plays the role of reference data. This kind of information is widely used for a wide range of users and applications as a general spatial context to spatially place their data in the real world and make it understandable. This data provides an accurate location of data from other domains, allows to overlay data from diverse sources and it is useful to analyze information by means of a common geographic context. This concept of reference data coming from geospatial domain can easily extend to other domains as Earth observation, statistics and in general any official data generated by public bodies in the execution of their duties. We recognize that reference data must be published as open data to best meet it purpose.","Please add 'open license' along with 'open formats' and 'free of charge'.","Perhaps add ', and makes them transparent' after 'strengthens our public and democratic institutions'.","Please add 'monitoring' along with 'development, implementation, and assessment'.","The functioning of these 'oversight and review processes' must be open and transparent themselves. The reporting should be public.","This must also include a point regarding the government proactively seeking data demands from citizens, CSOs, academics, and the private sector.","as well as empower marginalised groups' is too vague. Perhaps it can be made into a separate point, and qualified with what kinds of empowerment is needed - from demanding data, to accessing and using data, to be aware of the data collected from such groups by the government agencies.","This should be part of point 19.","The diversity point is almost already made with points 20-21 - widest possible users lead to widest possible use.","This is also covered under the Principle 3.","This should be part of Principle 1.","I agree with ABS. Why not 'non-governmental organisations and the private sector'?","Also the document shifts back and forth between 'civil society organisations' and 'non-governmental organisations'. If both mean the same in this document, then it should use only one.","This comment is not connected to this bullet point. Why not merge the Principle 4 and 5 so as to describe an overall situation of engagement and collaboration. The ends can be commercial acts or towards democratic practices, but the existing principles do not make much a difference between the two types of acts.","Further, can a new principle be added at the end that would address the implementation process of the Action Plan? Specifically, it should clarify how the implementation itself be an open process, with not only the Action Plan but annual reports regarding the status of implementation. This principle may connect to the work being done by the Implementation WG.","Remove the word \"sit\" and replace with \"sits\"","The Open Data by Default Principle should adequately address the issue of Data Privacy and Protection.","This principle should address the issue of standards.","Some countries may not have such legislation in place.

To solve the issue with the word \"government\" I propose to replace it with the word \"governance\" - this would include governmental agencies, ngos's, corporate or religious bodies, etc - whatever incorporates power over people.\n \n I'm not so sure about the word \"democratic\" - it might give the text a western twist, though even the most authoritarian regimes love to use it as a label for their rule.

The result was that data did not get compiled until Pro Publica decided to push a significant investigation: http://www.propublica.org/article/about-our-pharma-data\n \n Bottomline: A lack of standards for format and centralization of publication *will* load additional costs on to data users.","","1.

But I would add \"a culture of openness at all levels of government\". A culture of openness at executive level only will result in high-level commitments and policies but limited OD practice at the coal face (i.e. in the departments and agencies of government).","suggest \"time and resources to identify and prepare data for release or publication\".","","If we go into specifics (like economic growth), this paragraph should probably also mention increasing social equity, improving basic human rights, reducing poverty, etc.","Now I see that the document talks about these issues in the next paragraphs, however, it would be great to either have those included in the beginning, or leave the specifics for the rest of the document.","Effective access is a confusing term, and also maybe too subjective. Why don`t we just use `access` here? The goal of this whole document is to explain what we mean by meaningful access.","Agreed with Martin, this is way too negative phrasing for such a document.","I think the first sentence does not really add anything to the argument here: people want information because they want information. We should give examples here on why people want the data, and how they use it - just like in the second sentence.","This should either be much broader, or have no examples here at all. See Jonathan Grey`s great article for more case stories (http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/feb/20/open-data-day-fairer-taxes), the open data impact map (http://www.opendataenterprise.org/map/viz/index.html), or Sunlight`s research on social impact (https://www.scribd.com/doc/263776138/The-Social-Impact-of-Open-Data), and many many more.
